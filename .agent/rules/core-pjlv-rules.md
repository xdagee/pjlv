# PJLV Core Agent Rules

* Follow the Laravel official coding standards for PHP and Blade templates.
* Apply consistent naming conventions for models, controllers, services, and migrations.
* Always generate code with inline documentation and PHPDoc annotations.
* Do not modify files outside the `pjlv/` project directory unless explicitly instructed.
* Before generating or modifying any database migration file, confirm the schema change intent.
* Always reference SPEC files (`PROJECT_SPEC.md`, `QA_SPEC.md`) when planning or summarizing work.
