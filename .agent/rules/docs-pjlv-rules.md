# PJLV Documentation & Artifact Rules

* All workflow artifacts (`TASK_LIST.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`, `test_report.json`) must be generated with clear human-readable explanations.
* Include acceptance criteria references with line numbers or spec sections when summarizing.
* If generating a change log or release notes, include Jira/issue IDs and summary bullets.
* Always link artifacts back to the originating spec clause.
