# PJLV UI & UX Rules

* UI components must use the existing Blade layout conventions.
* Do not bypass the calendar component’s established color-coded leave styling.
* Provide screenshots for key user interactions affected by changes.
* Any UI text must be consistent with the project’s localization conventions.
